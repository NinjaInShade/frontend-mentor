## My process

### Built with

- ipIFY geolocation API
- LeafletJS map API
- Javascript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the leaflet map API to create and display a map based on a certain location, using their documentation. With ipIFY API, I also used their documentation, however this was a very simple process to get working with a fetch call.
