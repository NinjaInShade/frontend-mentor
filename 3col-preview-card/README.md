### What I learned

I loved the design on this challenge. Nothing really challenged me, neither did I really learn much from this one, but great for practice! One thing I will say, I adjusted my solution from the design images slightly on the mobile view.

I increased the margin between the card description and button on mobile view, where the cards are stacked. I felt more whitespace gave the design more room to breath and easier to read.
